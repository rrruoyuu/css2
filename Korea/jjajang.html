        <!-- DESCRIPTION (shown by default) -->
        <div class="desc-preview">
                <p>Jjajangmyeon is a popular Korean noodle dish made with thick wheat noodles topped with a rich black bean sauce cooked with diced pork or seafood and vegetables such as onions and zucchini. The sauce is savory, slightly sweet, and deeply flavorful, with a smooth and hearty texture that coats the noodles well.</p>
                <p>Jjajangmyeon is especially associated with Korean Black Day on April 14, when single people who did not receive gifts on Valentine’s Day (February 14) or White Day (March 14) gather to eat this dish together and share their feelings in a lighthearted way.</p>

                <h3>How to make Jjajangmyeon</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                <h3>Prepartion:</h3>
                    <li>Rinse the pork under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels. Coat the pork with the marinade sauce, mix well, and let it sit for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Cut the onion, zucchini, and potato into small cubes, thinly slice the mushrooms, chop the cabbage into small to medium pieces, and julienne the cucumber.</li>
                <h3>Cooking:</h3>
                    <li>Preheat a wok until it is hot, then add lard or cooking oil and let it melt.</li>
                    <li>Add the black bean paste and stir constantly over medium heat for 3–5 minutes, being careful not to burn it.</li>
                    <li>Add the brown sugar and stir for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Scoop out the paste (without the oil) and set it aside, leaving the oil in the wok for the next steps.</li>
                    <li>Add the pork to the wok and cook until it is halfway done.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the onion, zucchini, and potato and cook for 3–5 minutes until they are about one-third cooked.</li>
                    <li>Add the mushrooms and cabbage and stir for 2–3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Return the black bean paste to the wok and mix it with the vegetables, cooking for 1–2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the chicken stock, water, and rice wine, then simmer on medium heat for 5–7 minutes. (Covering the wok will speed up cooking.)</li>
                    <li>Add the slurry to thicken the sauces</li>
                    <li>While the sauce simmers, boil water in a separate pot and cook the noodles for 3–5 minutes. Rinse them under cold water, drain, and place in a serving bowl or plate.</lli>
                    <li>Pour the black bean sauce over the noodles. Optionally, garnish with cucumber slices or a hard-boiled egg.</li>
                    <li>Mix the noodles and sauce well with chopsticks and enjoy. Traditionally, jjajangmyeon is served with yellow pickled radish, which aids digestion. Eat promptly before the noodles become too soft.</li>

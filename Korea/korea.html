            <h1>Korean Cuisine</h1>
            <img src = "../images/korean.jpg">
            <p>Korean cuisine is known for its bold flavors, balance, and emphasis on shared meals. It often features a mix of spicy, savory, sweet, and fermented tastes, with ingredients like chili paste (gochujang), soybean paste (doenjang), garlic, and sesame oil playing a big role. Many dishes, such as kimchi, bulgogi, and bibimbap, highlight fermented foods, which add depth of flavor and are an important part of Korean food culture. Korean meals are usually served with multiple side dishes called banchan, encouraging variety and communal eating.</p>
            <p>In this food blog, we will list easy and authentic Korean recipes that are simple to follow at home. Each recipe will use traditional ingredients while keeping the steps clear and beginner-friendly, making Korean cooking accessible to everyone.</p>

                <h2>2. Tteokbokki (Stir-Fried Rice Cake)</h2>
                <img class="food-img" src="../images/tteok.jpg" alt="tteok"/>
                <p>Tteokbokki is one of the most popular Korean street foods in Korea, loved for its bold flavor and comforting texture. It is made with chewy cylindrical rice cakes simmered in a thick, spicy sauce made from gochujang, soy sauce, and sugar. Fish cakes, boiled eggs, and vegetables are often added to enhance the dish. Tteokbokki has a rich, spicy, and slightly sweet taste, with a soft yet chewy bite that makes it especially satisfying and addictive, especially when served hot.</p>
                <h3>Ingredients for Tteokbokki (Serves 2)</h3>
                <h4>Main</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>350g Korean Rice Cakes</li>
                    <li>150g Korean Fish Cakes</li>
                    <li>2 Cups of Korean Soup Stock (dried kelp and dried anchovy stock)</li>
                    <li>60g Onion, thinly sliced</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Tteokbokki Sauce</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 Tbsp Gochujang (Korean chili paste)</li>
                    <li> 1 1/2 Tbsp raw sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tsp Soy Sauce</li>
                    <li>1 tsp Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Garnish</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tsp Toasted Sesame Seeds</li>

                <h3>How to make Tteokbokki</h3>
                <p>1. Soak the rice cakes in warm water for about 10 minutes. If you are using fresh rice cakes that are already soft, you can skip this step. However, for packaged rice cakes stored in the refrigerator, soaking is recommended to improve their moisture and texture before cooking.</p>
                <p>2. Bring the soup stock to a boil in a shallow pot over medium-high heat, then stir in the tteokbokki sauce until it is fully dissolved. Once the seasoned stock is boiling, add the rice cakes, fish cakes, and onion, and continue cooking for another 3 to 5 minutes until the rice cakes are tender. Lower the heat and let it simmer for an additional 2 to 4 minutes to thicken the sauce and enhance the flavor.</p>
                <p>3. Add the sesame oil, sesame seeds, and green onion then quickly stir. Serve warm.</p>

                <img class="food-img" src="../images/Gimbap.png" alt="gimbap"/>
                <p>Kimbap is a popular picnic and everyday food in Korea, known for its convenience, colorful appearance, and balanced flavors. It is made by rolling cooked rice seasoned with sesame oil and salt together with a variety of fillings such as vegetables, egg, pickled radish, and sometimes meat or seafood, all wrapped in dried seaweed. Kimbap has a mild, savory, and slightly nutty taste, with a mix of soft rice, crisp vegetables, and flavorful fillings, making it light, satisfying, and easy to enjoy on the go.</p>
                <h3>Ingredients for Kimbap (Makes 4 rolls)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 Dried Seaweed Sheets</li>
                    <li>120g Spinach</li>
                    <li>2 Eggs, beaten</li>
                    <li>1/2 Carrot, julienned</li>
                    <li>2 to 4 Imitation Crab Sticks, cut in half length ways</li>
                    <li>4 sticks BBQ Kimbap Ham, cut into long strips</li>
                    <li>4 yellow Radish Pickle, cut into long strips</li>
                    <li>2 1/2 cups Steamed short Grain Rice</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp Sesame Oil</li>
                    <li>3/8 tsp Fine Sea Salt</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How to make Kimbap</h3>
                <p>1. Rinse the spinach and briefly blanch it in rapidly boiling water for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Drain, rinse with cold water, and gently squeeze out any excess moisture. Place the spinach in a bowl, add 1/8 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 tablespoon of sesame oil, then mix well.</p>
                <p>2. Preheat a pan or skillet with a small amount of cooking oil. Pour in the beaten egg and cook over medium heat until both sides are fully set. Transfer the omelette to a cutting board and slice it into long strips.</p>
                <p>3. Using a heated pan over medium heat, lightly cook the carrots, crab sticks, and kimbap ham separately, about 1 minute per ingredient. (These can be used raw, but lightly cooking them adds more flavor.)</p>
                <p>4. Place the cooked rice in a mixing bowl and season it with 1/2 tablespoon of sesame oil and 1/4 teaspoon of fine sea salt, adjusting to taste. Mix gently with a rice spatula.</p>
                <p>5. Arrange all the prepared ingredients at a kimbap rolling station to make assembly easier. Place a sheet of dried seaweed, shiny side down, on a bamboo mat. Spread the rice evenly and thinly over about two-thirds of the seaweed, leaving a 5 cm (2-inch) gap at the top.</p>
                <p>6. Layer the filling ingredients evenly across the rice. For example, place a strip of yellow pickled radish about one-third up the seaweed, then add burdock, ham, and a crab stick, followed by egg strips, carrots, and spinach. Roll the seaweed tightly using the mat.</p>
                <p>7. If the seaweed does not seal, lightly moisten the exposed edge with water or press a few grains of rice onto it. Set the finished roll aside and repeat the process with the remaining ingredients.</p>
                <p>8. Once all the kimbap rolls are ready, place them on a cutting board and lightly brush the outside with about 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. Slice into bite-sized pieces and serve.</p>

                <h3>How to make Jjajangmyeon</h3>
                <h3>Prepartion:</h3>
                <p>1. Rinse the pork under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels. Coat the pork with the marinade sauce, mix well, and let it sit for 15 minutes.</p>
                <p>2. Cut the onion, zucchini, and potato into small cubes, thinly slice the mushrooms, chop the cabbage into small to medium pieces, and julienne the cucumber.</p>
                <h3>Cooking:</h3>
                <p>1. Preheat a wok until it is hot, then add lard or cooking oil and let it melt.</p>
                <p>2. Add the black bean paste and stir constantly over medium heat for 3–5 minutes, being careful not to burn it.</p>
                <p>3. Add the brown sugar and stir for another 2-3 minutes.</p>
                <p>4. Scoop out the paste (without the oil) and set it aside, leaving the oil in the wok for the next steps.</p>
                <p>5. Add the pork to the wok and cook until it is halfway done.</p>
                <p>6. Stir in the onion, zucchini, and potato and cook for 3–5 minutes until they are about one-third cooked.</p>
                <p>7. Add the mushrooms and cabbage and stir for 2–3 minutes.</p>
                <p>8. Return the black bean paste to the wok and mix it with the vegetables, cooking for 1–2 minutes.</p>
                <p>9. Add the chicken stock, water, and rice wine, then simmer on medium heat for 5–7 minutes. (Covering the wok will speed up cooking.)</p>
                <p>10. Add the slurry to thicken the sauces</p>
                <p>11. While the sauce simmers, boil water in a separate pot and cook the noodles for 3–5 minutes. Rinse them under cold water, drain, and place in a serving bowl or plate.</p>
                <p>12. Pour the black bean sauce over the noodles. Optionally, garnish with cucumber slices or a hard-boiled egg.</p>
                <p>13. Mix the noodles and sauce well with chopsticks and enjoy. Traditionally, jjajangmyeon is served with yellow pickled radish, which aids digestion. Eat promptly before the noodles become too soft.</p>

                <h2>5. Kimchi Jeon (Kimchi Pancakes)</h2>
                <img class="food-img" src="../images/jeon.jpg" alt="jeon"/>
                <p>Kimchi pancakes, or kimchi jeon (김치전), are a popular Korean savory dish made by mixing chopped kimchi with a simple batter of flour, water, and sometimes egg, then pan-frying it until crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They are slightly spicy, tangy, and savory, with the fermented kimchi giving a rich, umami flavor. The crispy edges combined with the tender, flavorful interior make kimchi pancakes a satisfying snack or side dish, often enjoyed with a dipping sauce made from soy sauce, vinegar, and a touch of sugar.</p>
                <h3>Ingredients for Kimchi Jeon</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup Buchimgaru (Korean pancake mix) or plain all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 cup Icy Cold Water</li>
                    <li>1 cup Well-Fermented Kimchi, chopped in bite-sized pieces</li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp Kimchi Liquid</li>
                    <li>1 tsp Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)</li>
                    <li>Cooking Oil</li>
                    <li>Homemade Korean Pancake Dipping Sauce</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How to make Kimchi Jeon</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. In a medium bowl, mix the buchimgaru (Korean pancake mix) with water until the batter is smooth and lump-free. Stir in the chopped kimchi, kimchi juice, and finely ground Korean chili flakes until everything is evenly combined.</li>
                    <li>2. Heat a pan or skillet over medium-high heat until hot, then add a generous amount of cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface evenly. </li>
                    <li>3. Using a ladle, pour the batter into the pan, spreading it gently with the back of the ladle into a thin, round pancake about 5–6 inches wide. This size helps it cook evenly, crisp up at the edges, and makes flipping easier.</li>
                    <li>4. Cook the pancake over medium-high heat for 10–20 seconds to set the bottom, then lower the heat to medium. Continue cooking until it’s golden, crispy on the outside, and cooked through. If the pan gets too hot or the pancake browns too quickly, reduce the heat slightly. Add more oil as needed to keep it crispy and prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>5. When the pancake is about 70% cooked, flip it carefully once the bottom is golden and the top has started to set. Press gently with a spatula a few times to enhance crispiness.</li>
                    <li>6. Once both sides are golden and crispy, transfer the pancake to a cutting board, slice it into bite-sized pieces, and serve immediately. A small dish of Korean pancake dipping sauce makes the perfect accompaniment.</li>

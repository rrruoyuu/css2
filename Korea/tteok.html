                <p>Tteokbokki is one of the most popular Korean street foods in Korea, loved for its bold flavor and comforting texture. It is made with chewy cylindrical rice cakes simmered in a thick, spicy sauce made from gochujang, soy sauce, and sugar. Fish cakes, boiled eggs, and vegetables are often added to enhance the dish. Tteokbokki has a rich, spicy, and slightly sweet taste, with a soft yet chewy bite that makes it especially satisfying and addictive, especially when served hot.</p>

                <h3>How to make Tteokbokki</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Soak the rice cakes in warm water for about 10 minutes. If you are using fresh rice cakes that are already soft, you can skip this step. However, for packaged rice cakes stored in the refrigerator, soaking is recommended to improve their moisture and texture before cooking.</li>
                    <li>Bring the soup stock to a boil in a shallow pot over medium-high heat, then stir in the tteokbokki sauce until it is fully dissolved. Once the seasoned stock is boiling, add the rice cakes, fish cakes, and onion, and continue cooking for another 3 to 5 minutes until the rice cakes are tender. Lower the heat and let it simmer for an additional 2 to 4 minutes to thicken the sauce and enhance the flavor.</li>
                    <li>Add the sesame oil, sesame seeds, and green onion then quickly stir. Serve warm.</li>

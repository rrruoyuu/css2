        <div class="desc-preview">
            <p>Gimbap is a popular picnic and everyday food in Korea, known for its convenience, colorful appearance, and balanced flavors. It is made by rolling cooked rice seasoned with sesame oil and salt together with a variety of fillings such as vegetables, egg, pickled radish, and sometimes meat or seafood, all wrapped in dried seaweed. Kimbap has a mild, savory, and slightly nutty taste, with a mix of soft rice, crisp vegetables, and flavorful fillings, making it light, satisfying, and easy to enjoy on the go.</p>

                    <li>2 Tbsp Sesame Oil</li>

                <h3>How to make Gimbap</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Rinse the spinach and briefly blanch it in rapidly boiling water for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Drain, rinse with cold water, and gently squeeze out any excess moisture. Place the spinach in a bowl, add 1/8 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 tablespoon of sesame oil, then mix well.</li>
                    <li>Preheat a pan or skillet with a small amount of cooking oil. Pour in the beaten egg and cook over medium heat until both sides are fully set. Transfer the omelette to a cutting board and slice it into long strips.</li>
                    <li>Using a heated pan over medium heat, lightly cook the carrots, crab sticks, and kimbap ham separately, about 1 minute per ingredient. (These can be used raw, but lightly cooking them adds more flavor.)</li>
                    <li>Place the cooked rice in a mixing bowl and season it with 1/2 tablespoon of sesame oil and 1/4 teaspoon of fine sea salt, adjusting to taste. Mix gently with a rice spatula.</li>
                    <li>Arrange all the prepared ingredients at a kimbap rolling station to make assembly easier. Place a sheet of dried seaweed, shiny side down, on a bamboo mat. Spread the rice evenly and thinly over about two-thirds of the seaweed, leaving a 5 cm (2-inch) gap at the top.</li>
                    <li>Layer the filling ingredients evenly across the rice. For example, place a strip of yellow pickled radish about one-third up the seaweed, then add burdock, ham, and a crab stick, followed by egg strips, carrots, and spinach. Roll the seaweed tightly using the mat.</li>
                    <li>If the seaweed does not seal, lightly moisten the exposed edge with water or press a few grains of rice onto it. Set the finished roll aside and repeat the process with the remaining ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Once all the kimbap rolls are ready, place them on a cutting board and lightly brush the outside with about 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. Slice into bite-sized pieces and serve.</li>

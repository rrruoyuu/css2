        <div class="desc-preview">
            <p>Kimchi pancakes, or kimchi jeon (김치전), are a popular Korean savory dish made by mixing chopped kimchi with a simple batter of flour, water, and sometimes egg, then pan-frying it until crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They are slightly spicy, tangy, and savory, with the fermented kimchi giving a rich, umami flavor. The crispy edges combined with the tender, flavorful interior make kimchi pancakes a satisfying snack or side dish, often enjoyed with a dipping sauce made from soy sauce, vinegar, and a touch of sugar.</p>
                <h3>Ingredients for Kimchi Jeon</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup Buchimgaru (Korean pancake mix) or plain all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 cup Icy Cold Water</li>
                    <li>1 cup Well-Fermented Kimchi, chopped in bite-sized pieces</li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp Kimchi Liquid</li>
                    <li>1 tsp Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)</li>
                    <li>Cooking Oil</li>
                    <li>Homemade Korean Pancake Dipping Sauce</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How to make Kimchi Jeon</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>In a medium bowl, mix the buchimgaru (Korean pancake mix) with water until the batter is smooth and lump-free. Stir in the chopped kimchi, kimchi juice, and finely ground Korean chili flakes until everything is evenly combined.</li>
                    <li>Heat a pan or skillet over medium-high heat until hot, then add a generous amount of cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface evenly. </li>
                    <li>Using a ladle, pour the batter into the pan, spreading it gently with the back of the ladle into a thin, round pancake about 5–6 inches wide. This size helps it cook evenly, crisp up at the edges, and makes flipping easier.</li>
                    <li>Cook the pancake over medium-high heat for 10–20 seconds to set the bottom, then lower the heat to medium. Continue cooking until it’s golden, crispy on the outside, and cooked through. If the pan gets too hot or the pancake browns too quickly, reduce the heat slightly. Add more oil as needed to keep it crispy and prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>When the pancake is about 70% cooked, flip it carefully once the bottom is golden and the top has started to set. Press gently with a spatula a few times to enhance crispiness.</li>
                    <li>Once both sides are golden and crispy, transfer the pancake to a cutting board, slice it into bite-sized pieces, and serve immediately. A small dish of Korean pancake dipping sauce makes the perfect accompaniment.</li>

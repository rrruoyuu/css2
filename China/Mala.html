                Mala is a bold and flavourful style of Chinese cuisine that comes from Sichuan,
                 China. The word mala means “numbing and spicy,” which describes the unique sensation 
                 created by Sichuan peppercorns and dried chillies. This combination gives mala dishes 
                 their signature tingling heat that lingers on the tongue.

                Mala is commonly used in dishes such as stir-fries, soups, and hotpot, where meats, 
                vegetables, and tofu are cooked in a rich, aromatic sauce. With its strong spices,
                 deep flavours, and exciting taste, mala is especially popular among those who enjoy 
                 spicy food and adventurous flavours.

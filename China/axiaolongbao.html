                Xiao Long Bao, also known as soup dumplings, is a famous Chinese dish that originated 
                from the Jiangnan region, especially Shanghai. These delicate dumplings are filled with 
                minced meat and rich, savoury soup, all wrapped in a thin layer of dough. When steamed, 
                the soup melts inside, creating a juicy and flavourful bite.

                Xiao Long Bao is traditionally eaten by carefully lifting the dumpling, taking a small 
                bite to sip the soup, and then enjoying the rest with dipping sauce made of vinegar and ginger. 
                Loved for its soft texture and comforting taste, Xiao Long Bao is a popular dish enjoyed in 
                teahouses and restaurants across China.

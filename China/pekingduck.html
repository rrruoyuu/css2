                Peking Duck is one of China’s most famous traditional dishes, known for its
                crispy skin and tender meat. Originating from Beijing, this dish is usually
                roasted until golden and served with thin pancakes, spring onions, cucumber,
                and sweet bean sauce.

                The duck skin is prized for its crunch, while the meat remains juicy and flavourful.
                Peking Duck is often enjoyed during special occasions and shared among family
                and friends.

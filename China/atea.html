                Oolong tea is a traditional Chinese tea that is known for its rich aroma and smooth, balanced flavour. It falls between green 
                and black tea in terms of oxidation, giving it a unique taste that can range from light and floral to deep and roasted. Oolong 
                tea is commonly enjoyed in China for its refreshing qualities and is often served during meals or tea gatherings.

                This tea is carefully processed through withering, rolling, and partial fermentation, which brings out its complex flavours. 
                Oolong tea is especially popular in tea ceremonies, where its fragrance and taste can be appreciated over multiple brews. 
                With its layered flavour and calming effect, oolong tea is a favourite choice among tea lovers.

                Green tea is one of the most popular and widely enjoyed teas in China, known for its fresh taste and natural aroma. Unlike black tea, 
                green tea is minimally processed, which helps preserve its light colour and clean flavour. It is often enjoyed warm and is appreciated 
                for its refreshing and soothing qualities.
            <p>
                Common varieties of Chinese green tea include Longjing (Dragon Well) and Biluochun, which are valued for their delicate taste and gentle 
                sweetness. Green tea is frequently enjoyed as part of daily life and traditional tea culture, offering a calming drink that reflects simplicity, 
                balance, and a close connection to nature.

                Da Hong Pao is one of the most famous and highly valued oolong teas in China, originating from the Wuyi Mountains in Fujian province. It is known 
                for its deep, rich flavour and roasted aroma, with tasting notes that are smooth, warm, and slightly sweet. This tea is traditionally grown on rocky 
                cliffs, which contributes to its distinctive mineral taste.
            <p>
                Da Hong Pao is carefully roasted, giving it a bold character while maintaining a balanced and lingering aftertaste. It is often enjoyed slowly during 
                tea sessions, where its flavour can be appreciated over multiple infusions. As a symbol of tradition and craftsmanship, Da Hong Pao holds a special place 
                in Chinese tea culture.

                Tea plays an important role in Chinese culture and daily life, with a history that dates back thousands of years. It 
                is enjoyed not only as a drink but also as a symbol of hospitality, relaxation, and respect. Chinese tea comes in many 
                varieties, each offering different flavours, aromas, and health benefits, and it is often served during meals or social gatherings.

                for their natural taste and soothing qualities, and many people enjoy them as part of traditional tea ceremonies. Whether 
                enjoyed hot or warm, Chinese tea reflects a deep connection between nature, tradition, and everyday life.

                Oolong tea is a traditional Chinese tea that is known for its rich aroma and smooth, balanced flavour. It falls between green 
                and black tea in terms of oxidation, giving it a unique taste that can range from light and floral to deep and roasted. Oolong 
                tea is commonly enjoyed in China for its refreshing qualities and is often served during meals or tea gatherings.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tea is carefully processed through withering, rolling, and partial fermentation, which brings out its complex flavours. 
                Oolong tea is especially popular in tea ceremonies, where its fragrance and taste can be appreciated over multiple brews. 
                With its layered flavour and calming effect, oolong tea is a favourite choice among tea lovers.

            <h2>🍵 Oolong Tea – Home Brewing Guide</h2>
            <h2>Must-Have Tools</h2>

    <ul class="ingredient-list">
        <li>
            <strong>Gaiwan or Yixing Clay Teapot</strong><br>
            A gaiwan (lidded cup) gives precise control over steeping time, while a Yixing clay teapot
            gradually absorbs tea aromas, enhancing future brews.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Kettle with Temperature Control</strong><br>
            Oolong tea is sensitive to heat, so controlling water temperature is important.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tea Scale</strong><br>
            Measuring by weight ensures consistency—use 5–7 g of tea per 150 ml of water.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Timer</strong><br>
            Prevents over-steeping, which can make oolong bitter.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Filtered Water</strong><br>
            Clean, low-mineral water keeps flavours clear and vibrant.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🌿 Ingredients</h2>

    <ul class="ingredient-list">
        <li>
            <strong>High-Quality Loose-Leaf Oolong Tea</strong><br>
            Choose loose leaves instead of tea bags. Popular styles include light floral oolong,
            roasted oolong, or creamy high-mountain oolong.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Fresh Water</strong><br>
            Use cold, filtered water. Avoid re-boiling water, as it loses oxygen and dulls the taste.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Quality leaves make a big difference—good oolong shines even with simple brewing.

            </ul>
        </li>

            <strong>Step 2: Measure the Leaves</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Add 5–7 g of oolong tea to the warm vessel</li>
                <li>Light oolong: closer to 5 g</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Light oolong: 85–90°C (185–195°F) to preserve floral notes</li>
                <li>Dark oolong: 93–96°C (200–205°F) for deeper, roasted flavours</li>
                <li>If boiling, let the water cool briefly before pouring</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <p></p>

                <li>Pour a small amount of hot water over the leaves</li>
                <li>Swirl gently and discard after 5 seconds</li>
                <li>This awakens the leaves and releases aroma</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <p></p>

        <li>
            <strong>Step 5: Steep and Enjoy</strong>

                        <li>Light oolong: 30–45 seconds</li>
                        <li>Dark oolong: 45–60 seconds</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Second steep:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Light: 45–60 seconds</li>
                        <li>Dark: 60–90 seconds</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Later steeps: add 15–30 seconds each time</li>
                <li>Oolong can be infused 5–7 times</li>

                Green tea is one of the most popular and widely enjoyed teas in China, known for its fresh taste and natural aroma. Unlike black tea, 
                green tea is minimally processed, which helps preserve its light colour and clean flavour. It is often enjoyed warm and is appreciated 
                for its refreshing and soothing qualities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Common varieties of Chinese green tea include Longjing (Dragon Well) and Biluochun, which are valued for their delicate taste and gentle 
                sweetness. Green tea is frequently enjoyed as part of daily life and traditional tea culture, offering a calming drink that reflects simplicity, 
                balance, and a close connection to nature.

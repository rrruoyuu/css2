    <h3>History of Curry Rice</h3>
    <p>
      Japanese curry rice was introduced to Japan during the late 19th century
      through the British Navy. Originally based on Indian curry, it was adapted
      to suit Japanese tastes, becoming thicker, milder, and slightly sweet.
      Over time, curry rice became a popular home-cooked meal and a staple in
      Japanese households, school lunches, and restaurants.

          Okonomiyaki (お好み焼き) is a popular and comforting Japanese savoury 
          pancake, especially associated with Osaka and Hiroshima, where it is 
          enjoyed as a casual street food or shared meal. Known for its rich, hearty
           flavour and crisp-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside texture, it is a dish
            that feels both filling and fun to eat.

          The name literally means “grilled as you like it,” highlighting its versatility 
          and customizable nature. Made with a batter mixed with shredded cabbage, 
          okonomiyaki can include ingredients such as pork, seafood, or cheese, and is 
          cooked on a hot griddle. It is typically finished with a generous drizzle of
           savoury sauce, mayonnaise, and dried toppings, creating a balanced blend of 
           sweet, salty, and umami flavours.

          Miso soup (味噌汁) is a classic and beloved Japanese staple, valued for its
           comforting warmth and deep savoury umami flavour. Light yet nourishing, 
           it is often one of the first dishes served at the table and is enjoyed by
            people of all ages as part of everyday meals.        
        </p>

          This simple soup is made by dissolving fermented soybean paste (miso) into
           dashi stock, creating a gently salty and aromatic broth. Common 
           ingredients such as tofu, seaweed, and spring onions are added for texture
            and balance. Frequently enjoyed in Japanese households, miso soup is 
            appreciated not only for its taste but also for its nutritional value and 
            soothing, home-cooked feel.
